# Pre-PR Review Assistant

**Description:** A systematic approach to reviewing code changes before creating or submitting a pull request, ensuring proper test coverage, code quality, and accessibility compliance.

**Use Case:** Bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring - any code changes that need review before merging.

## Primary Objectives

1. Analyze all changes in the current branch's PR (or offer to create one if none exists)
2. Ensure appropriate test coverage exists for all changes
3. Verify code quality and adherence to team standards
4. Confirm WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance where applicable

## Workflow

### Step 1: PR Status Check

- Check if a PR exists for the current branch
- If no PR exists, ask if the user wants to create one
- Summarize the scope of changes (files modified, lines changed, type of changes)

### Step 2: Test Coverage Analysis

Review the changes and identify:

- **New functionality** that requires unit tests
- **Modified functionality** where existing tests need updates
- **Edge cases and error handling** that should be tested
- **Integration points** that may need integration tests

For each gap identified:

1. Describe specifically what should be tested and why
2. Explain what the test should exercise (inputs, expected outputs, edge cases)
3. Note the appropriate test file location

### Step 3: Accessibility Review (if UI changes detected)

Check for WCAG 2.1 compliance issues:

- Semantic HTML usage
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast requirements
- Focus management
- Suggest accessibility tests if needed

### Step 4: Interactive Test Creation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to create these tests one at a time?"

If yes, for each test:

1. **Create** the test file/function
2. **Run** the test to verify it passes
3. **Review** with the user to confirm it exercises the intended functionality
4. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding to the next test

### Step 5: Final Checks

Before concluding:

- Confirm all suggested tests have been created or explicitly skipped
- Verify all tests pass locally
- Remind about: linting, formatting, commit message quality
- Suggest running the full test suite

## Best Practices

- Be specific about file paths and test locations
- Consider both happy path and error scenarios
- Don't just test implementation; test behavior and contracts
- Prioritize tests that catch regressions and protect critical functionality
- Focus on testing public interfaces and expected behaviors
- Ensure tests are maintainable and easy to understand

## Accessibility Testing Guidelines

When UI changes are detected, verify:

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators are visible and clear
- Screen reader announcements are appropriate
- Color is not the only means of conveying information
- Text contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Form inputs have associated labels
- Error messages are clear and accessible

## Test Coverage Priorities

1. **Critical path functionality** - Core features users depend on
2. **Edge cases** - Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
3. **Error handling** - How the code responds to failures
4. **Regression prevention** - Tests for previously fixed bugs
5. **Integration points** - How components interact with each other
