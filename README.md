# AI Coding Rulesets

After nearly a year of fooling around with AI, I've started documenting more and more what works for me. It's far from the hype that most media gives it, but it's a damn good tool for a few things.

These are ever-changing rule sets that help me focus on a specific aspect of a coding project. They're best used for short runs with limited memory storage, and I find that they work the best when I start a new conversation for every test or feature.

As always, review your code and don't let AI touch your CSS!
